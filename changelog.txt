FAQ

1. Where'z teh options?
Take a look into your World of Warcraft folder: Interface\Addons\dNamePlates\config.lua. You can open this file with Wordpad, Notepad or any other text editor. I recommend Notepad++ - it's free, google it.

note: If you change anything, you have to reload your interface, either via /rl, /console reloadui or log out ingame.


2. How do I change the font?
One of the things you can change via config.lua is the font. There are 2 options to be exactly. You can choose to use a different font for text (names) and numbers, or use the same for both.
dNamePlates comes with a few fonts (take a look at Interface\Addons\dNamePlates\media). You can add your own fonts easily, Just copy them into dNamePlates's media folder and add them via config.lua.
If you want to get rid of those pixel fonts, I recommend using the Prototype font that comes with dNamePlates.
